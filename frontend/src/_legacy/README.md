# üóÇÔ∏è LEGACY CODE ARCHIVE

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT USE FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT**

## What's in this folder?

This folder contains the **original HTML/CSS implementation** of the Palaver Institute website that has been **completely replaced** with modern React components.

### Files:
- `app/` - Original HTML-style page components
- `components/` - Old components with CSS class dependencies

### Why it's kept:
- **Reference**: To understand original functionality
- **Backup**: Safe fallback if needed during migration
- **History**: Preservation of development journey

## For New Developers:

**IGNORE THIS FOLDER COMPLETELY**

Use the modern components in the main `src/` directory:
- `src/components/ui/` - Modern UI components
- `src/components/layout/` - Layout components  
- `src/components/sections/` - Page sections

---

**This folder will be removed once the migration is fully stable.**
